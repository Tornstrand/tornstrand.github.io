# Football Playbook Creator

This repository hosts a simple browser-based tool to sketch American football plays.
Add players, name them, drag them into position and use the **Draw Route** button to
sketch routes on a vertical field.

Enter a label in the **Player name** box before adding a player or select an existing
player and press **Rename Player** to update its label.

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to start designing plays.
